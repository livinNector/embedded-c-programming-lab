# Preface {.unnumbered}

This book contains the help documents and the exercises for the Embedded C Programming Lab.

## IDEs
There are two groups of exercises which will be using the following IDEs.

- STMCubeIDE with STM HAL - [Getting Started](getting_started/stmcube_ide_getting_started.qmd)
- Arduino IDE (V2) with Stm32duino - [Getting Started](getting_started/arduino_ide_with_stm32duino.qmd)

Basic IO, Serial Communication, External and Timer interrupts will be discussed with STMCubeIDE and 
Interfacing with Sensors will be done using Arduino IDE.

:::{.callout-note}
The exercises that are done using Arduino IDE can also be done using STMCubeIDE.
